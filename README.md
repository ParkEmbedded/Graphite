# Graphite Shell For Mobile Devices.
This project is based on the [Terbium Project](https://github.com/TerbiumOS/webOS).
## What is Graphite?
### Graphite is a mobile shell interface for mobile devices. This graphical shell is <br> written in Javascript, HTML & CSS to ensure that everything is stable & relaible.

## What is the purpose of this project?
### The purpose of this project is to provide another operating system / mobile desktop environment that <br> isn't written in Gecko (KaiOS). It is also a way for upcomming developers to make their own versions <br> of Park and publish it for their own mobile devices.
